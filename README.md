# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment mall customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers to better understand their spending behavior, which could be used for marketing strategies such as targeted promotions or customer retention plans.

## Introduction

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics. In this project, we use K-Means clustering to divide mall customers into groups based on their spending patterns and annual income, helping businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project, `Mall_Customers.csv`, contains the following fields:
- **CustomerID**: Unique ID assigned to each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income**: Annual income of the customer in USD.
- **Spending Score**: The spending score assigned to the customer based on their behavior and purchasing data.

## Results  

Elbow Method
The elbow method was used to identify the optimal number of clusters.

Clusters Visualization
The mall customers were clustered into 5 distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score. The centroids of each cluster are marked to show the center of each group.
